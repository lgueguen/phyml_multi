The file simSeq.phy contains an example alignment in which a recombination event occured. This is one of the simulated alignments as found in the 
"Evolutionary Bioinformatics" article. The breakpoint should be found at position 599.
To use phyml_multi, type: 

For use with the phylo-HMM: 
phyml_multi simSeqs.phy 0 i 1 0 HKY e e 4 e BIONJ y y y 2

and then to see the segmentation: 
python PartitioningHMM.py simSeqs.phy_phyml_siteLks.txt 0.997973
or : 
python PartitioningMM.py simSeqs.phy_phyml_siteLks.txt 


For use with the mixture model: 
phyml_multi simSeqs.phy 0 i 1 0 HKY e e 4 e BIONJ y y n 2

and then to see the segmentation:
python PartitioningMM.py simSeqs.phy_phyml_siteLks.txt

This should give you the right answer, in a matter of a few minutes on a single desktop computer.
